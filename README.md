# VHDL
These files are targeted at 7 series Xilinx FPGAs (or sometimes UltraScale), although most constructs are portable.
They will typically require VHDL 2008.

At the moment this is just a library of general purpose blocks, but there will eventually be "cores" as sets of related files all intended to acomplish a single task.
